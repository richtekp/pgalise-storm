Provides two possiblities to connect to a PGALISE (@TODO link) simulation.
<ol>
<li>Connect through sockets (default port is ) and let storm pull the data over 
it, configuration takes place in 
configuration files ...</li>
</li>This client exposes a XMLRPC at the address and port to be configured in 
configuration file .... This allows the PGALISE simulation to push data to 
to storm using a XMLRPCPushOutput.</li>
</ol>
